## Introduction
This project began several years ago as a network load-balancing middleware for distcc, designed to enable the traditional GNU Make to efficiently utilize CPU resources across a custom cluster of compiler servers. 
After extensive debugging on the working servers, the project runs smoothly on a cluster of seven CentOS 7 servers. 
However, some components are still not performing as expected. Fortunately, the projectâ€™s architecture and code style remain solid. 
I am now focused on rewriting and improving certain parts of the project, with a goal of enhancing its load-balancing intelligence.

## Todo
[] cluster classification(allow needs of different compiler toolkit chain for different compiling tasks )
[] libncurses for `./monitor`(just for better stdout)
[] new tier classification(now tiers are specified without taking the load of compiler-server into account)
[] ...
